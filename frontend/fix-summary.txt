=== SUMMARY OF FIXES APPLIED ===

✅ ISSUE 1: Spatial coordinate adjustments now working properly
   - SupertilesMenu component updated to pass complete level data including spatial objects (items, fences, splines, liquids)
   - adjustSpatialCoordinates function properly receives and processes spatial data
   - Objects maintain relative positions when adding/removing from top/left sides
   - Demonstrated with working coordinate adjustments: +128 pixels for items, fences, splines, liquids

✅ ISSUE 2: Download functionality fixed 
   - Fixed immer state updates to use proper draft mutations instead of object spread
   - Eliminated 'Cannot assign to read only property' errors during map downloads
   - State updates now follow React/Immer patterns correctly

✅ ADDITIONAL FIX: YCrd vertex data sizing corrected
   - Fixed YCrd array sizing from tile count to vertex count: (width+1) × (height+1)
   - Eliminates 'ImageData length not multiple of (4 * width)' errors in tiles menu
   - All 17 unit tests passing with correct expectations

✅ VERIFICATION:
   - Coordinate adjustment demonstration shows proper spatial object repositioning
   - Items moved from (50,100) to (178,100) when adding left column (+128 X adjustment)
   - Items moved from (50,100) to (50,228) when adding top row (+128 Z adjustment)  
   - Fence, spline, and liquid coordinates adjusted proportionally
   - No adjustments when adding to right/bottom sides (as expected)

Both reported issues have been comprehensively addressed with verified fixes.
