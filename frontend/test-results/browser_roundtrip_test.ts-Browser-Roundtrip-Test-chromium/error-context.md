- paragraph: This is a work in progress level editor for Otto Matic (And hopefully additional Pangea Software games).
- paragraph: Introducing items that were not originally found in the level will be likely to cause Otto Matic to crash. Downloaded levels can be used by replacing the existing by level data, which can be found in the Terrain folder within Otto's Data folder. Otto Matic has strict limits for enemies, which means that placed enemy items may not appear. This can be bypassed by adding enemies as spline items.
